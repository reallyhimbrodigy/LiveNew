# Citations registry (non-medical)

This registry provides optional, lightweight links that support general education language in plans. It is not medical advice.

- Source of truth: `public/citations.json`
- API: `GET /v1/citations`
- Contract: `{ id, title, url, note }[]`

Guidelines:

1) Keep citations broad and educational.
2) Avoid medical claims or prescriptive language.
3) Prefer stable, public references.
